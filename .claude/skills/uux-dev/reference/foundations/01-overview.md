# Temenos UUX Design System - Overview

## What is the Temenos UUX Design System?

The Unified UX (UUX) design system is a comprehensive design language that unifies product teams around a common visual vocabulary. It serves as an extension of the existing Temenos style guide, built on top of Google's Material Design principles, providing a foundation for creating consistent, accessible, and engaging user experiences across all Temenos products.

### Foundation

The UUX design system is based on:
- **Google's Material Design** - Following established, user-familiar patterns
- **Temenos Style Guide** - Extending existing brand guidelines
- **Themed Components** - Consistent look and feel across products
- **Modern Interactions** - Contemporary UX patterns for great user experiences

## Why Use a Design System?

Using the UUX design system benefits the design and development process in several critical ways:

### Consistent
Acts as a single source of truth for design decisions, promoting best practice consistency in areas such as accessibility, color usage, and component behavior.

### Rapid
Accelerates the design and development process by providing a solid foundation and clear guidance for all design decisions, eliminating debates about basic patterns.

### Efficient
Reduces design and technical debt by providing reusable, well-tested components and patterns that work together seamlessly.

### Collaborative
Builds bridges between design, development, and product teams working together to bring products to life with a shared language.

## Design Principles

Four fundamental principles underpin the UUX design system and guide all design decisions:

## 1. Simple and Progressive

**Aim for a concise, unambiguous design that takes the user on the shortest possible journey, revealing new paths as they become relevant. No surprises.**

### Simplify
Every user experience should be intuitive, eliminating obvious elements and keeping only what is essential. Progressive disclosure of functionality, controls, and content minimizes confusion. By reducing clicks, steps, data inputs, and new concepts, a well-designed UX presents users with only what they need to achieve their goals.

### Consumable
Design and present concepts so they are clear and understandable. Show the right amount of information and functionality at the right time while taking care to avoid information overload.

### Proactive
Create proactive features, systems, and experiences that consistently surpass user expectations for both simplicity and power.

## 2. Power to Cut Through

**Maintain a careful balance between speed, familiarity, and the technical bleeding edge. Find speed where you can while making the user feel like they have been here before.**

### Unlock Speed
Enhance the perception of speed using techniques such as:
- Caching and prefetching
- Lazy loading
- Loading indicators and skeleton loaders
- Optimized performance, data processing, and microservices

### Friendly and Powerful
Make the user experience feel familiar. Keep interactions and workflows simple but stay technically powerful.

### Technically Advanced
Temenos excels at producing feature-rich and functionally powerful solutions. Design with balance to achieve the most suitable approach for each use case, avoiding friction while maintaining technical power.

## 3. User Needs Before Solutions

**A great design presents the right features in a familiar way that can be used by anyone and everyone.**

### Meet Your Customers Where They Are
Success is measured by how well and efficiently we fulfill users' needs, not by the number of features shipped. Use research to understand and build empathy with the target audience's viewpoint, and inform decisions through discovery and curiosity.

### What Users Know
Components and patterns are informed by what users already know. Material Design principles guide our component design to avoid unfamiliar UI patterns and functionality.

### Designed for All
Technology is most powerful when it empowers everyone. Create UI and UX that adapts easily to diverse languages, cultures, and accessibility standards. A great design is comfortable and intuitive for everyone.

## 4. Aesthetics with a Purpose

**Our products are crafted with care to give users a great experience. Form and function work together to be engaging while providing context and clarity.**

### Engaging
Techniques such as data visualization and microinteractions help keep the user's attention on the task at hand. High quality UI and UX are non-negotiable and contribute to an engaging experience. Use design to create hierarchy, meaning, and focus.

### Context
Reinforce context so users always know where they are. Highlight events let users know they are making progress and are on the right track. Give feedback through animations and microinteractions so users know the system is listening.

### Clarity
Clear purpose drives all aesthetic decisions. Keep UI and content language short, unambiguous, and to the point. Deliver powerful functionality without bombarding the UI and user.
